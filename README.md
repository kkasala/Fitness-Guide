# Fitness Guide
DEPENDENCIES:


```
Tkinter 8.6 

```

Nowadays, everyone aspires to maintain a healthy and fit body. As a result, the demand for weight loss and fitness applications is increasing. Therefore, in this project I want to develop a basic program that would help the users set a fitness goal. After gathering relevant information from the user, it will inform them about his/her fitness status and assists them in setting a goal. 

HOW TO RUN:
On running the program in IDLE shell, a window will open for the user, which allows the user to specify their age, weight, height, gender and activity level. When the user clicks the Calculate button a new window will open, which shows the user the number of calories they are burning per day and asks the user their fitness goal. When the user chooses an option and click next, a messagebox will open with a personalised fitness goal set for them.

INPUT:
The input in this project will be the text that users enter in the entry widget (age, height, weight, and calories burnt).

OUTPUT:
Final Output of the project will be the fitness status of the user and a fitness goal that is set for them.
